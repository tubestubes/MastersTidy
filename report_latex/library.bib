   abstract = {The day-to-day route choice is a non-cooperative game process with many participants during a long time period. The multi-agent simulation system SeSAm is used to investigate two different route update rules designed for traffic information release and unrelease respectively. Simulation results on a small grid network show that the rule under information release can make route flow evolve to the logit-based stochastic user equilibrium faster than that under information unrelease. However, the flow pattern may be unstable if travelers put undue compliance on the released information. A stable flow pattern can also be achieved only relying on travelers' perceived experience and learning ability, but the evolution is rather slow. It is thus suggested that the traffic information should be timely released to public meanwhile utilized properly.},

   abstract = {Most analyses of driver-network transportation systems rest on the presence of network equilibrium. Equilibrium analyses presuppose that the driver is rational and homogeneous and has perfect information. A more realistic view, however, is that individuals? rationality is bounded because of their cognitive limitations. A driver is assumed to adopt simple rules when he chooses a route. A model system in which the driver?s learning is simulated with multiple rules is applied to investigate the validity of the hypotheses underlying network equilibrium. The results of simulation analyses can be summarized as follows. Drivers do not become homogeneous and rational, as equilibrium analyses presuppose; rather, there are fewer rational drivers even after a long process of learning, and heterogeneous drivers make up the system. Drivers? attitudes toward and perceptions of each route do not become homogeneous either but become bipolar. The results point to the need for a critical appraisal of the foundation of the equilibrium analysis of network flow.},

These models are embedded inside a microscopic (agent-based) simulation framework and model to study their collective effects on the day-to-day behavior of traffic flows through a series of experiments.

In this paper, we propose a day-to-day route choice model based on reinforcement learning and multiagent simulation. Travelers’ memory, learning rate, and experience cognition are taken into account. Then the model is verified and analyzed. Results show that the network flow can converge to user equilibrium (UE) if travelers can remember all the travel time they have experienced, but which is not necessarily the case under limited memory; learning rate can strengthen the flow fluctuation, but memory leads to the contrary side; moreover, high learning rate results in the cyclical oscillation during the process of flow evolution. Finally, both the scenarios of link capacity degradation and random link capacity are used to illustrate the model’s applications. Analyses and applications of our model demonstrate the model is reasonable and useful for studying the day-to-day traffic dynamics.},

   abstract = {Traffic network modelling is a field that has developed over a number of decades, largely from the economics of predicting equilibria across route travel choices, in consideration of the congestion levels on those routes. More recently, there has been a growing influence from the psychological and social science fields, leading to a greater interest in understanding behavioural mechanisms that underlie such travel choice decisions. The purpose of the present paper is to describe mathematical models which aim to reflect day-to-day dynamic adjustments in route choice behaviour in response to previous travel experiences. Particularly, the aim is to set these approaches in a common framework with the conventional economic equilibrium models. Starting from the analysis of economic equilibria under perturbations, the presentation moves onto deterministic dynamical system models and stochastic processes. Simple illustrative examples are used to introduce the modelling approaches. It is argued that while such dynamical approaches have appeal, in terms of the range of adaptive behavioural processes that can be incorporated, their estimation may not be trivial. In particular, the obvious solution technique (namely, explicit simulation of the dynamics) can lead to a rather complex problem of interpretation for the model-user, and that more “analytical” approximation techniques may be a better way forward.},

   abstract = {In this study, we assume that drivers under day-to-day dynamic transportation circumstances choose routes based on Bayesian learning and develop a day-to-day dynamic model of network flow. This model reveals that a driver using Bayesian learning chooses the route that frequently takes the minimum travel time. Furthermore, we find that the equilibrium point of the day-to-day dynamic model is identical to Wardrop’s equilibrium. Under complete information (when information about which route takes the minimum travel time is given after the trips), Wardrop’s equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the day-to-day dynamic system converges to Wardrop’s equilibrium if initial recognition among drivers is distributed widely. Under incomplete information, Wardrop’s equilibrium is always globally asymptotically stable regardless of what the drivers’ initial recognition is. Paradoxically, the condition for stable equilibrium under incomplete information is more relaxed than that under complete information.},

   abstract = {Existing day-to-day traffic assignment models are all built upon path flow variables. This paper demonstrates two essential shortcomings of these path-based models. One is that their application requires a given initial path flow pattern, which is typically unidentifiable, i.e. mathematically nonunique and practically unobservable. In particular, we show that, for the path-based models, different initial path flow patterns constituting the same link flow pattern generally gives different day-to-day link flow evolutions. The other shortcoming of the path-based models is the path-overlapping problem. That is, the path-based models ignore the interdependence among paths and thus can give very unreasonable results for networks with paths overlapping with each other. These two path-based problems exist for most (if not all) deterministic day-to-day dynamics whose fixed points are the classic Wardrop user equilibrium. To avoid the two path-based problems, we propose a day-to-day traffic assignment model that directly deals with link flow variables. Our link-based model captures travelers’ cost-minimization behavior in their path finding as well as their inertia. The fixed point of our link-based dynamical system is the classic Wardrop user equilibrium.},

   abstract = {Real-life systems are known to exhibit considerable day-to-day variability. A better understanding of such variability has increasing policy-relevance in the context of network reliability assessment and the design of intelligent transport systems. Conventional equilibrium models are ill-suited, because deterministic models such as these do not account for any kind of variability. At best, these types of models are restricted to finding a steady state of the mean flow patterns, they cannot capture the variance in flows as well. A more suitable alternative are stochastic day-to-day dynamic models studied by Cascetta in Trans Res 23:1–17, (1989). These types of traffic assignment models represent the traffic flows via a Markov process, where the current route flows are modelled as a function of previous traffic conditions. Day-to-day dynamic models differ from equilibrium models in that day-to-day changes in the system are modelled dependent on the time and thus allow for a far wider representation of traveller behaviour. However, to some degree they still suffer from some of the limitations of equilibrium analyses, in that while they permit variation they are still wedded to the concept of ‘stationarity’. In this paper, we show how these Markovian day-to-day dynamic traffic assignment models can be extended by replacing a subset of the fixed parameters in the Markov model with random processes. The resulting models are analogous to Cox process models. They are conditionally non-stationary given any realization of the parameter processes. We present numerical examples that demonstrate that this new class of doubly stochastic day-to-day traffic assignment models can indeed reproduce features such as the heteroscedasticity of traffic flows observed in real-life settings.},

   abstract = {Day-to-day dynamic traffic models have considerable potential as tools for transport network management and planning, and also for the study of traveller behaviour. However, their efficacy for these purposes is dependent on appropriate model selection. In particular, while it can be tempting to incorporate sophisticated and intricate representations of traveller learning in day-to-day models, it is important to ask whether the available data are able to support such a level of model complexity. To this end, our overall aim is to investigate the extent to which it is possible to learn about day-to-day traveller behaviour from observations on traffic counts collected over a sequence of days. The paper makes two specific contributions. The first is the development of a principled Bayesian methodology for comparing day-to-day models using link count data, and a description of how it may be implemented in practice using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The second contribution is a suite of simulation studies that examine whether these techniques can select the correct model within a set of alternatives with a variety of complexities of behavioural representation. We find that successful model choice based on link count data is often possible when travellers are relatively sensitive to differences in route utilities.},

   abstract = {This paper analyzes how a central agent may bring a mixed traffic system including both human-driven and autonomous vehicles to an equilibrium that both maximizes the efficiency and is stable under the control. The evolution of the human drivers’ route choices, as well as the agent's control measures, is described using a joint day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model based on probability route choice. Within this setting, we show that (1) the fixed point of the proposed dynamical system coincides with the unique mixed equilibrium, and (2) the system is asymptotically stable in continuous time, namely it always converges to the mixed equilibrium from a given initial state. We then examine how alternative control policies may affect the transition trajectory leading to the mixed equilibrium. Two alternative control schemes are proposed and analyzed. The first, referred to as the stability-first control, aims to stabilize a given disequilibrium as soon as possible. The second seeks to minimize the total system cost accumulated over the transition period, hence called the efficiency-first control. We propose a continuous time optimal control formulation for both schemes and discuss how the formulation can be discretized and solved to local optimality using existing algorithms. Numerical experiments conducted on two illustrative examples highlight the differences among the three control schemes and how the share of autonomous vehicles affects the tradeoff between the efficiency and stability of the mixed traffic system.},

   abstract = {Employing vehicle communication and automated control technologies, autonomous vehicles (AVs) can safely drive closer together than human-driven vehicles (HVs), thereby potentially improving traffic efficiency. Separation between AV and HV traffic through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes is foreseen as an effective method of amplifying the benefits of AVs and promoting their adoption. However, it is important to consider mixed AV and HV traffic in a transportation network. On the one hand, it may be impractical to deploy dedicated AV lanes throughout the network, while on the other hand, dedicated AV lanes may even reduce the total traffic efficiency of a road segment when the AV flow rate is low. In this study, we considered a new form of managed lanes for AVs, designated as autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes, which grant free access to AVs while allowing HVs to access the lanes by paying a toll. We investigated the optimal deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes in transportation networks with mixed AV and HV flows. The user equilibrium (UE) problem in a transportation network with mixed flows of AVs and HVs is first explored. We formulated the UE problem as a link-based variational inequality (VI) and identified that, with different impacts of AVs on road capacity, the UE problem can have unique or non-unique flow patterns. Considering that the UE problem may have non-unique flow distributions, we proposed a robust optimal deployment model, which is a generalized semi-infinite min-max program, to deploy the dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes so that the system performance under the worst-case flow distributions is optimized. We proposed effective solution algorithms to solve these models and presented numerical studies to demonstrate the models and the solution algorithms. The results show that the system performance can be significantly improved through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes.},

   abstract = {Compared to existing human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer users the potential for reduced value of time, enhanced quality of travel experience, and seamless situational awareness and connectivity. Hence, CAV users can differ in their route choice behavior compared to HDV users, leading to mixed traffic flows that can significantly deviate from the single-class HDV traffic pattern. However, due to the lack of quantitative models, there is limited knowledge on the evolution of mixed traffic flows in a traffic network. To partly bridge this gap, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment model, where HDV users and CAV users follow different route choice principles, characterized by the cross-nested logit (CNL) model and user equilibrium (UE) model, respectively. The CNL model captures HDV users’ uncertainty associated with limited knowledge of traffic conditions while overcoming the route overlap issue of logit-based stochastic user equilibrium. The UE model characterizes the CAV's capability for acquiring accurate information on traffic conditions. In addition, the multiclass model can capture the characteristics of mixed traffic flow such as the difference in value of time between HDVs and CAVs and the asymmetry in their driving interactions, thereby enhancing behavioral realism in the modeling. The study develops a new solution algorithm labeled RSRS-MSRA, in which a route-swapping based strategy is embedded with a self-regulated step size choice technique, to solve the proposed model efficiently. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is performed to gain insights into the effects of perturbations on the mixed traffic equilibrium, which facilitates the estimation of equilibrium traffic flow and identification of critical elements under expected or unexpected events. The study results can assist transportation decision-makers to design effective planning and operational strategies to leverage the advantages of CAVs and manage traffic congestion under mixed traffic flows.},

   abstract = {Most research and applications of network equilibrium models are based on the assumption that traffic volumes on roadways are virtually certain to be at or near their equilibrium values if the equilibrium volumes exist and are unique. However, it has long been known that this assumption can be violated in deterministic models. This paper presents an investigation of the stability of stochastic equilibrium in a two-link network. The stability of deterministic equilibrium also is discussed briefly. Equilibrium is defined to be stable if it is unique and the link volumes converge over time to their equilibrium values regardless of the initial conditions. Three models of route choice decision-making over time are formulated, and the stability of equilibrium is investigated for each. It is shown that even when equilibrium is unique, link volumes may converge to their equilibrium values, oscillate about equilibrium perpetually, or converge to values that may be considerably different from the equilibrium ones, depending on the details of the route choice decision-making process. Moreover, even when convergence of link volumes to equilibrium is assured, the convergence may be too slow to justify the standard assumption that these volumes are usually at or near their equilibrium values. When link volumes converge to non-equilibrium values, the levels at which the volumes stabilize typically depend on the initial link volumes or perceptions of travel costs. Conditions sufficient to assure convergence to equilibrium in two of the three models of route choice decision-making are presented, and these conditions are interpreted in terms of the route choice decision-making process.},

   abstract = {Equilibrium analyses of transportation networks are by their nature “static,” with equilibrium configuration defined as “fixed” or “autoreflexive” points, i.e. flow patterns reproducing themselves on the basis of the assumptions made on users' behavior once reached by the system. In this paper it is argued that no transportation system remains in the same state over successive periods because of the action of several causes (e.g. temporal fluctuation of level and composition of demand, users' choices, and travel costs). This implies that the sequence of states occupied by the system over successive epochs or times of similar characteristics (e.g. am peak hour of working days) is the realization of a stochastic process, the type of which depends on, among other things, the choice mechanism followed by travelers. Stationarity of the stochastic process within fixed potential demand and network structures is considered to be a desirable property because it allows a flow pattern distribution to be associated to each demand-network system independently of its starting configuration and elapsed time. Furthermore, this stationarity makes it possible to define expected path and link flows and compare them with those of stochastic user equilibrium (SUE). In this paper rather general sufficient conditions for the process stationarity are given, essentially calling for a “stable” choice mechanism of potential users. In the following a particular model of temporal dynamics (STODYN), based upon a number of simplifying assumptions on users' behavior common to most assignment models, is described. Exact and approximate relationships between STODYN steady-state expected flows and SUE average flows are also analyzed both in the case of unique and multiple equilibria. The possible use of STODYN as an assignment model giving unique average flows along with their variances and covariances is then discussed. The model takes into account stochastic fluctuations of demand and can be easily extended to other “dimensions” such as distribution and modal choice. Some results of an empirical analysis comparing STODYN average flows with SUE and observed flows on two urban car networks are also reported.},

   abstract = {This paper contains a quantitative evaluation of probabilistic traffic assignment models and proposes an alternate formulation. First, the concept of stochastic-user-equilibration (S-U-E) is formalized as an extension of Wardrop's user-equilibration criterion. Then, the stochastic-network-loading (S-N-L) problem (a special case of S-U-E for networks with constant link costs) is analyzed in detail and an expression for the probability of route choice which is based on two general postulates of user behavior is derived. The paper also discusses the weaknesses of existing S-N-L techniques with special attention paid to Dial's multipath method and compares them to the suggested approach. The proposed model seems reasonable and does not exhibit the inherent weaknesses of the logit model when applied to sets of routes which overlap heavily. The discussion is supported by several numerical examples on small contrived networks. The paper concludes with the discussion of two techniques that can be used to approximate the link flows resulting from the proposed model in large networks.},

After the basic principles of agent-based simulation are briefly introduced, its four areas of application are discussed by using real-world applications: flow simulation, organizational simulation, market simulation, and diffusion simulation. For each category, one or several business applications are described and analyzed.ABM, agent-based modelingNASDAQ, National Association of Security Dealers Automated QuotationISP, Internet service provider},

   abstract = {Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a new approach to modeling systems comprised of autonomous, interacting agents. ABMS promises to have far reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision making and researchers use electronic laboratories to support their research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a third way of doing science besides deductive and inductive reasoning. Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications in a variety of fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of biowarfare, from modeling consumer behavior to understanding the fall of ancient civilizations, to name a few. This tutorial describes the theoretical and practical foundations of ABMS, identifies toolkits and methods for developing ABMS models, and provides some thoughts on the relationship between ABMS and traditional modeling techniques.},

   abstract = {The day-to-day route choice is a non-cooperative game process with many participants during a long time period. The multi-agent simulation system SeSAm is used to investigate two different route update rules designed for traffic information release and unrelease respectively. Simulation results on a small grid network show that the rule under information release can make route flow evolve to the logit-based stochastic user equilibrium faster than that under information unrelease. However, the flow pattern may be unstable if travelers put undue compliance on the released information. A stable flow pattern can also be achieved only relying on travelers' perceived experience and learning ability, but the evolution is rather slow. It is thus suggested that the traffic information should be timely released to public meanwhile utilized properly.},
