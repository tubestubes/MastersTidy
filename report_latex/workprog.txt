\section{Work Program [[[DELETE]]]}
\subsection{Stage 1}
Develop a program to simulate drivers day-to-day route choice behaviour using python.

State 1 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Establish python environment and packages for this project. Check all necessary software is installed and licensed for the duration of this project.
\item Establish driver rules at the conceptual level.
\item Formulate bottom-up model for drivers.
\item Develop driver class.
\item Create a test network(s). Formulate cost functions.
\item Model network in python.
\item Perform test simulation, check for errors.
\end{itemize}

State 1 milestones:
\begin{itemize}
\item A prepared computing environment.
\item Fully developed driver class with rules and goals.
\item Fully developed network with nodes links and costs functions.
\item A python script to run a simulation with given parameters.
 \end{itemize}

Estimated time for this stage: 4 weeks.

\subsection{Stage 2}
Analyse the impact of different driver behaviours and system parameters.

Stage 2 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tune system parameters for realistic performance.
\item Vary system parameters and drivers rules to study their effect on performance.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
Stage 2 milestones:
\begin{itemize}
\item A well-tuned model.
\item Data on network performance under different inputs.
\end{itemize}

Estimated time for this stage: 1 week.

\subsection{Stage 3}
Analyse the impact of different model assumptions deemed relevant to the difference in behaviour between autonomous and human drivers.

State 3 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine what driver rules suit autonomous vehicles
\item Study effect of chosen rules on performance.
 \end{itemize}

Stage 3 milestones:
\begin{itemize}
\item Outline of what an AV looks like in the model.
\end{itemize}

Estimated time: 1 week.

\subsection{Stage 4}
Develop a model to simulate a mixed system of autonomous and human drivers (AVs and HVs), and their route choice behaviour.

Stage 4 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a class for AVs from the previous driver class
\item Formulate network with AV flow
\item Simulate with both AVs and HVs, test the simulation for errors.
\end{itemize}

Stage 4 milestones:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fully developed AV class with rules and goals.
\item Fully developed network with nodes links and costs functions for HVs and AVs.
\item A python script to run a working simulation.
\end{itemize}

Estimated time: 2 weeks.

\subsection{Stage 5}
Determine what behaviours and parameters for autonomous drivers optimise the flow through the network.

Stage 5 tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vary parameters and run simulations, check for errors.
\item Collect data to determine what parameters optimise the network.
\end{itemize}

Stage 5 milestones:

Estimated time: 2 weeks.

Estimated project completion: 21 August 2020, assuming project starts on 01 June 2020.

\subsection{Equipment Needed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computer
\item Python installation, and packages.
\item Cloud back-up service such as OneDrive and GitHub.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk Assessment}
This project can easily be considered low-risk due to its theoretical nature and does not need specialized equipment or labs. Table 1 summarises the risks associated with this project.
